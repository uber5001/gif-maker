### Bower

In order to manage out front end components and libraries, we're using a tool called `bower`. It's a package manager for front-end packages.

Start by installing nodejs and npm, and then:

	npm install -g bower

Bower is installed. When in the root of your copy of the repo, run:

	bower install

This will give you all the needed components (polymer, bootstrap, or anything else we choose to use) and places them in a folder named `bower_components/`. If the `bower.json` file changes (i.e.: someone added or removed a library), just run `bower install` once more.

For more information, Google "bower".
